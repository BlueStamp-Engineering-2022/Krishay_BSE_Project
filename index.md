# Security Camera
My intensive project is a security camera that can detect objects. Whenever an object is detected, an email is sent to a given address.

# Final Milestone
In this last milestone, I added a modification, which was making a website to view the live security feed. This website helps users see what is exactly going on in the security camera's location, and it was made with HTML, CSS, and a Python framework called flask. In addition to the stream, it also has more information about the project. The code for the website can be found in the GitHub repository.

# Second Milestone
The second milestone of this security camera project was about programming the camera and getting it to send emails, and I used Python to do this. Whenever a face is detected, the camera constructs an email and sends it to a given address. The object to be detected can also be changed to detect a full body, or just the upper body of a person. Also, the email function only works within a certain time interval of 30 seconds. If an object has been detected but an email has been sent within the previous 30 seconds, then no email is sent. This exists so that the user is not annoyed, and it can also be configured to a different time.

# First Milestone
The first milestone of my project was mainly about setting the Raspberry Pi up and installing all the necessary components. I also worked on the design and the casing of the project, and I modified it to use a Raspberry Pi 3 rather than a Raspberry Pi Zero W. The Zero was too slow, and it took too long to install the necessary dependencies for the project (OpenCV took 9 - 12 hours to compile on it). Additionally, there were some issues with the version of the software that was installed on it. Anyways, for this milestone, I mentioned before that I used a new case. The case is transparent so that you can see the components inside, but I still haven't decided whether I want to paint over it or not. I attached the camera to the case with velcro, and I taped down the ribbon cable so that it wouldn't move when the project was on.

# Starter Project
My starter project was the Simon Says Game. I soldered different parts, such as LEDs, capacitors, an IC, battery connectors, and a resistor. I enjoyed soldering the components, but I struggled with cutting the excess wire left after soldering. One thing that I found helpful was to stop pulling the wire and start using more pressure to actually cut the wire.
