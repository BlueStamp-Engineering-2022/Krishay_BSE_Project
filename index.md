# Security Camera
My intensive project is a security camera that can detect objects. Whenever an object is detected, an email is sent to a given address.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
The first milestone of my project was mainly about setting the Raspberry Pi up and installing all the necessary components. I also worked on the design and the casing of the project, and I modified it to use a Raspberry Pi 3 rather than a Raspberry Pi Zero W. The Zero was too slow, and it took too long to install the necessary dependencies for the project (OpenCV took 9 - 12 hours to compile on it). Additionally, there were some issues with the version of the software that was installed on it. Anyways, for this milestone, I mentioned before that I used a new case. The case is transparent so that you can see the components inside, but I still haven't decided whether I want to paint over it or not. I attached the camera to the case with velcro, and I taped down the ribbon cable so that it wouldn't move when the project was on.

# Starter Project
My starter project was the Simon Says Game. I soldered different parts, such as LEDs, capacitors, an IC, battery connectors, and a resistor. I enjoyed soldering the components, but I struggled with cutting the excess wire left after soldering. One thing that I found helpful was to stop pulling the wire and start using more pressure to actually cut the wire.
